"ccl\_ipd" is a small Python module which breaks a BlackBerry IPD backup file into its data types. This can be used in scripts designed to parse databases in IPD files.

It allows access to the databases, records and fields in the IPD file and has a number of pythonic features to make the use of he module as straightforward as possible (see the example script).

For help in reverse engineering the data in IPD files please check out [Rubus](http://www.ccl-forensics.com/rubus), our free tool for reverse engineering data in IPD files.
